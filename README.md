DiverCity seeks to answer the question: how does the diversity of New York City's high schools affect the college-readiness of their students? By using the 2017-18 Diversity Report available from the NYC Open Dataset [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2017-2018-Diversity-Report-9-12-School/hyht-buiu), we created a visualization showing the schools' college-readiness of graduates as a function of their diversity.

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) defines a "racially representative" school as one where the combined percentages of Black and Hispanic students (which we defined as "minority") is between 50 and 90 percent. Seventy percent of NYC public school students identify as Black or Hispanic. To define college readiness, we used the Post-Secondary Enrollment eighteen months after high school graduation, provided by the NYCDOE.

We created a "diversity index" based on the difference between the percentage of minority students in NYC public schools writ large and at that specific school, which is represented by a color gradient. Lighter colours indicates a school that represents NYC's racial and ethnic makeup, and darker colours indicates a very homogenous school. The size of the circles corresponds to the Post-Secondary Enrollment.

The webpage is interactive and presents the user with the different metrics when they mouse over the data. The plot of different college readiness metrics with respect to the percentage of minority students is available through a slideshow.
